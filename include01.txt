In this application we will explore the return of an investment in 2 assets where the total amount invested is 
divided between both assets in different percentages adding always 100%.
The assets are from the Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corporation, symbols "AAPL", "MSFT". The first one is from Apple, the electronics company. The second is from Microsoft, a software corporation.
The slider may be used to change the percent invested in one asset. As this percent changes, the other asset 
changes as well to keep the sum equal to 100%.
It is possible to have negative percentages meaning a 'short position', that is the case when the investor has 
sell borrowed shares of one of the assets to leverage the investment in the remaining asset.
The plot shows, for each combination of assets in the portfolio, the expected return in 1 year, the risk which 
represents the volatility in the combined prices of the portfolio and the percent invested in each asset. 
The vertical axis shows the expected return of the portfolio; the horizontal axis plots the associated risk. As 
the curve moves to the left of the horizontal axis the risk decreases but the return of the investment also 
decreases.
